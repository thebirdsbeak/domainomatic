<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>To use the domainomatic, first load a new csv file. You can 
find the required format in the readme, or by checking the 
dummy_domains file in the assets directory.</p>

<p>Once a domain is loaded, you can toggle the settings and 
switches as appropriate. Remember to hit 'Save' for your chances 
to take!</p>

<p>Once you've entered all of the relevant settings, and have 
taken a screenshot, you can generate a cease and desist 
correspondence automatically.</p>

<p>For detailed guidance, see the 
<a href="#">User Guide</a>, which 
is available offline via the help 
menu.</p>
